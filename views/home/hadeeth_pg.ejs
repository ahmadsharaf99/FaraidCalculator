I (again said): Then one-third. He (the Holy Prophet) observed silence after (I had asked permission to give away) one-third. He (the narrater) said: It was then that endowment of one-third became permissible.</p>

They said: Allah's Messenger (may peace upon him) is in the state of unconsciousness.</p>
